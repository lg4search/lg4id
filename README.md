The algorithm checks for "GGG" sequences in 1500 bp non-sliding windows. If greater than 120 "GGG" sequences are found, the window is returned to the user. You can access the user interface here http://omnisearch.soc.southalabama.edu:8080/g4search.

The 'driver' method in quadsearch_modified.py needs to be called to obtain the desired result.
